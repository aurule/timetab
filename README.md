TimeTab
=======

Create a timeline from tabular data.

It's pretty dumb about label collision, but it gets the markers in the right place, which is what I needed at the beginning. More to come, most likely.

All you need is Python 2.7 and a terminal. Run `python timetab.py --help` for usage instructions.

Data Files
=========

No documentation yet, but see the Examples directory. The files there should be pretty self-explanatory. Of note, the CSV file can have a third column: time.
